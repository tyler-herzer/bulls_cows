Situations:
1) If unknown bull loc, single out location
2) If no bull/1 cow, single out cow

Deductions:
1) If total c/b goes down: removed is good, added is bad
2) If total c/b goes up: removed is bad, added is good
3) If total c/b same, BUT composition changes:
	b went down, c went up: removed is good loc, added is good
	b went up, c went down: removed is good, added is good loc
4) If total c/b same, AND composition same:
	removed and added are both bad OR both good
	test by removing diff and adding same
	if total c/b same: all 3 are bad

Notes:
ALWAYS add a new number to a confirmed bull loc

yes:
4
no:
